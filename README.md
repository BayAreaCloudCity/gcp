# Cloud City *on Google Cloud Platform*

This project is a demo of using Google Cloud Platform to build a smart city application. 
We built a traffic model for predictive speed analysis on I-880 using straightforward machine learning modeling techniques to demostrate this. 

This README only contains instructions on how to deploy this file system. 
Please refer to our project report to learn more about our design.
